Transcendental crypting POC 

Transcrypt (contraction of Transcendental Crypting) is a new and innovative point-to-point encryption algorithm, based on a discovery about a property of the transcendental number Pi, in 1995, by the French-Canadian mathematician Simon Plouffe. 
Among the five criteria (confidentiality, integrity, availability, non-repudiation and authentication) of the security of an information system, Transcrypt only addresses confidentiality. 
The Transcrypt transcendental encryption principle is the subject of a Soleau envelope deposit by Miss Alex-Pauline Poudade (national deposit number: DSO2017001085 and deposit reference 260819711812005332017) at the National Institute of Industrial Property (INPI) since February 2, 2017. Its explicit and written authorization is required for any use for profit.

Transcrypt along with its TransOwl wrapper is the winner of the 1st edition of the Paris Regional Computer Science Competition "Les Trophées NSI" (INRIA, Talents du numérique, Région Ile-de-France).
